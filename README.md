# Weber State University - Admissions Web Site

This is the code base for the Admissions site redesign

## Notes

Main scss and css files are compiled in /pages, not /css
Each sub-page has a local scss file that is compiled to the main css file

The GetIntoWeber "Visit" page is also maintained here.

The /admissions-counselors directory also includes all the code for the interactive "hover map."
