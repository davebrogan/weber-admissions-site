                <p class="main-content__item__text">We get it... sending your kids off to college is a big deal and can be scary! But don&rsquo;t worry, we are here to put your mind at ease and show you how your student can pursue their dreams here at Weber State.&nbsp;<br />
                    &nbsp;</p>

                <h2 class="main-content__item__title">Great Value</h2>

                <p class="main-content__item__text">Our low tuition, paired with generous financial aid and scholarships AND quality programs, makes Weber State a great return on investment. We continue to receive awards and recognition for our students graduating with little to no debt and going on to do great, great, great things! We are one of the only universities in the state (a nation) to offer 4-year academic scholarships. This takes away the uncertainty and stress of reapplying every year and lets our students focus on learning and igniting their passion.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="main-content__item">
                <h2 class="main-content__item__title">Great Teaching</h2>

                <p class="main-content__item__text">Personal attention from professors who care. Our students are not a nameless face in a giant lecture hall. We often joke that the best thing about Weber State is that the professor knows your name, and the worst thing is that the professors know your name. Our students benefit from hands-on learning from professionals. They also have the opportunity to gain real-world experience through internship and job opportunities before they graduate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="main-content__item">
                <h2 class="main-content__item__title">Great Commitment</h2>

                <p class="main-content__item__text">We serve our students and communities so we can all succeed together. We don&rsquo;t just have great faculty, our staff -- from the president and provosts to advisors and assistants-- are dedicated to every student&rsquo;s success from the first day to graduation. We are proudly rooted in our community, our region, and our state as an educator of the workforce, an idea generator, and an employer. Always looking to support local businesses, we work with companies to develop programs and degrees specific to their needs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="main-content__item">
                <h2 class="main-content__item__title">Stackable Credentials</h2>

                <p class="main-content__item__text">Students start with a certificate or associate&rsquo;s degree. Travel or move right into a bachelor&rsquo;s program. Work in your field awhile. Come back for a master&rsquo;s. Reach your peak with a doctorate. Flexible schedules and stackable credentials keep you moving ever upward without losing credits or time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="main-content__item">
                <h2 class="main-content__item__title">Quality Academics</h2>

                <p>At Weber State, students will not only find what they&rsquo;re looking for academically &mdash; we have 225+ certificate and degree programs and 16 graduate programs &mdash; they also find professors who put teaching first. Our small classes give Wildcats significant opportunities to discover their passions, research topics from anthropology to zoology and change the world through service-learning.&nbsp;<br />
                    &nbsp;</p>

                <h2 class="main-content__item__title">Beautiful Location</h2>

                <p>Our main campus is nestled at the base of the Wasatch Mountains in Ogden, Utah &mdash; a vibrant and diverse city that has earned a national reputation as a great place to live, raise a family and do business. Northern Utah offers outdoor recreation activities for all four seasons, as well as world-class culture, arts, and sports. We also have eight campus and center locations across northern Utah, offering a variety of flexibility.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <h2 class="main-content__item__title">Impressive Outcomes</h2>

                <p>From fortune 500 companies and self-made entrepreneurs to Olympic athletes and Pulitzer Prize winners, our students go on to do great, great, great things. Chances are you have heard of a few of our alumni, and we aren&rsquo;t just talking about Damian Lillard, although he is a great example.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Not only is your kid going to be prepared for greatness, they can also graduate with little to no debt. No, we are not kidding, at Weber State University, you can earn a debt-free degree. Check out our <a href="https://weber.edu/affordability">affordability</a> page where we break it all down.</p>
