            <p class="card-bio__text">Social Work isn&#39;t about seeing the cup half empty or half full, it&#39;s about recognizing that the cup can be refilled. It is also about recognizing that there might be barriers to refilling it! I am super pleased to be this year&#39;s club President and am even more pleased that I get to work with such awesome people. A pun master by nature, I love to annoy those around me with paper jokes. Truly tear-able, Ha Ha, Get it? I strive to be a better Social Worker, friend, and intersectional feminist every day.</p>

            <p class="card-bio__text">My name is Josie Chambers,&nbsp;I began my journey here at Weber State&nbsp;in 2016 hoping to become a Radiology Technician. Since starting at Weber I got married, bought a house, adopted a dog and a cat, and changed my major.&nbsp; I quickly fell in love with the idea that I could help individuals through Social Work.&nbsp; After I graduate from Weber State I plan on attending Graduate School to become a Licensed Clinical Social Worker.&nbsp; Serving people is my passion and I am so excited to be a part of the Social Work Club my senior year at Weber State.&nbsp; &quot;How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment to improve the world.&quot;&nbsp;- Anne Frank</p>
