When performing page maintenance, or making any changes to pages from the IDE side:

Create a branch called edits-20XXXXXX

Make all edits on that branch

Copy the existing deploy file to backup file.
Use dev file version to build changes if they are complex or require new CSS
If the changes are content or links only make changes in deploy
If using dev, test in weber-dev or copy page. When code is ready copy/paste to deploy.
Copy/paste deploy to live page in SM
If editing directly in deploy file, copy over to SM live page when ready.

Commit the changes

Merge branch back to master
